        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p>The play "Death of a Salesman" by Arthur Miller primarily takes place in two main settings:</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>1. The Loman Family Home:</strong> The majority of the play unfolds within the confines of the Loman family's home, located in Brooklyn, New York. The house serves as a physical representation of the Lomans' struggles, dreams, and disappointments. It is a modest, cramped space that reflects the financial instability and lack of success experienced by Willy Loman, the protagonist, in his career as a traveling salesman. The home also becomes a stage for the conflicts and tensions within the Loman family, as they navigate the challenges of their relationships and confront the disparity between their aspirations and reality.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>2. Various Locations:</strong> Alongside the home setting, the play incorporates various other locations that reflect Willy's past, his imagination, and his travels. These settings are often depicted through flashbacks and memories. They include hotel rooms, restaurants, Willy's workplace, and the mindscapes of Willy's illusions. These additional settings contribute to the fragmented narrative structure of the play and provide insights into the characters' histories and the contrasting realities they face.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The contrasting environments of the Loman family home and the diverse locations visited throughout the play serve as backdrops for exploring the themes of the American Dream, identity, and the fragility of success in a capitalist society.</p>

        <h3>Allusions</h3>
        <p>"Death of a Salesman" contains several allusions that add depth and meaning to the play. One notable allusion is the reference to the mythological figure of Narcissus. Willy Loman's excessive self-absorption and obsession with his own image mirror Narcissus, who fell in love with his own reflection.

        <br>

The allusion to Ben emphasizes Willy's desire for financial success and the influence of societal ideals on his perception of self-worth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Additionally, the character of Charley, Willy's neighbor, alludes to the biblical figure of Job. Like Job, Charley remains steadfast in the face of adversity and maintains his integrity despite Willy's struggles. This allusion highlights the theme of moral fortitude and contrasts Willy's flawed character with Charley's resilience.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Arthur Miller, the playwright, also alludes to the Great Depression and the challenges faced by the American working class during that era. The economic hardships of the time serve as a backdrop for Willy's struggles and contribute to the larger themes of disillusionment, social expectations, and the elusive nature of the American Dream.</p>
