        <h3>Things To Know Before Reading</h3>
        <p class="text">
            <ol>
                <li>The handmaid’s tale is a dystopian novel written by Margaret Atwood and was first published in 1985.</li><br>
                <li>Margaret Atwood had this to say about the events of the handmaid’s tale; “As with The Handmaid’s Tale, I didn’t put in anything that we haven’t already done, we’re not already doing, we're seriously trying to do, coupled with trends that are already in progress... So all of those things are real, and therefore the amount of pure invention is close to nil.”</li><br>
                <li>The theme of women’s rights, power, and hypocrisy is explored throughout the novel. The women are given little to no say about what happens to them. In contrast, the males who have consolidated all the power in this society, on the basis on moral uprightness, live very hypocritical lives.</li><br>
                <li>All the handmaids in the novel are not referred to by their original name. The name used to address them is derived from a combination of two words: “Of” + their commander’s name. This naming system reduces them to the status of property.</li><br>

        <h3>Setting</h3>
        <p class="text">Set in a hauntingly vivid and chillingly plausible future, "The Handmaid's Tale" immerses readers in the dystopian Republic of Gilead, a society built upon the ruins of the United States. This oppressive world is meticulously crafted with meticulous attention to detail, painting a picture of a totalitarian regime where every aspect of life is tightly controlled. The setting exudes an aura of palpable fear and surveillance, with the omnipresent Eyes constantly monitoring and punishing any signs of dissent. Gilead is a place where women are stripped of their autonomy, reduced to their reproductive capabilities, and assigned rigid roles based on their social class. The atmosphere is suffused with an eerie mix of religious fanaticism and moralistic oppression, where the distorted interpretations of scripture serve as a weapon of control. The architectural landscape reflects the regime's desire to erase the past, as old landmarks are repurposed or demolished, leaving behind a disorienting blend of the familiar and the unfamiliar. Against this backdrop of despair and societal decay, the characters navigate a treacherous world where trust is a luxury and rebellion comes at a devastating cost. The setting of "The Handmaid's Tale" serves as a potent metaphor for the fragility of freedom, the enduring power of hope, and the indomitable human spirit in the face of extreme adversity.</p>
